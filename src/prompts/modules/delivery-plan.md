# Delivery Plan Checklist Criteria

Checklist completion criteria (must be true before marking `[x]`):

- Fully implements mapped requirements/spec sections (R-### / S-###) across code, tests, and docs; no partial implementations.
- Tests exist for success, failure, and boundary cases; referenced TV-<nnn> are implemented and traceable.
- Public API, types, invariants, and error contracts match Spec/Contracts; invariants enforced in code and validated by tests.
- Production code satisfies the Implementation Standards section.
- Required traceability tags are present and follow the formats from the Implementation Standards section.

# Delivery Plan Editing Policy

- Builders must not edit Delivery Plan text, names, or order. Only check/uncheck checklist items to reflect completion.
- Do not rename or remove Delivery Plan items during implementation.
- If Delivery Plan content needs to change, pause implementation and route the edits through the Update section before continuing.
